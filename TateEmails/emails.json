learnt to fight many thousands of years before.\r\n\r\n\nThis grass was blessed by 9,999 butterflies of varying colors.\r\n\r\n\nMaster Po would pluck them from the sky before releasing them unharmed at lightning speed. Grabbing and hurting a butterfly is doable.\r\n\r\n\nTo snatch one from the sky without damaging it, was the art.\r\n\r\n\nTheir irreplicable flight patterns are what built Po\u0027s irreplicable style.\r\n\r\n\nHe could pluck a butterfly from the sky - and with the exact same movement he could pluck your throat from your neck.\r\n\r\n\nEvery few hundred years you would see him once again descend into the meadow and dance through the grass snatching and releasing many butterflies per second in a dizzying display.\r\n\r\n\nThe butterflies were not only unharmed, but invigorated by their momentary capture. Often fluttering particularly fast and high upon release.\r\n\r\n\nAs if in to the heavens above. As adept number 1, I understood I would one day succeed Po himself. I had to learn what he knew. To do what he could do.\r\n\r\n\nSo I decided to attempt the same.\r\n\r\n\nI stood amongst the grass and began to move.\r\n\r\n\nTigers claw failed, along with my snake fist. I spent 23 days moving, quickly and slowly, grasping at nothing but air.\r\n\r\n\nThe butterflies would land on me as if to taunt, but my hands touched nothing.\r\n\r\n\nBy my 24th day my technique had begun to fail.\r\n\r\n\nMy footwork was sloppy and my stances irregular. Instead of correcting myself, I let it happen, and 3 hours later I caught my first butterfly.\r\n\r\n\nI didn\u0027t know it then, but these irregular movements of traditional style were the beginnings of Tateshinkai.\r\n\r\n\nExcited, I held it in my hands as gently as I could, and ran back to the temple to show Master Po.\r\n\r\n\nI ran up to him as he was drinking his tea. \u0022Master, Master, I have caught a butterfly!\u0022 I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\nHe slowly placed his tea cup on the ground and a tear began to run down his face.\r\n\r\n\nPerplexed I continued \u0022What\u0027s the matter? I have been very gentle, she is alive!\u0022 It was at this moment that I opened my hands.\r\n\r\n\nAnd although I had been gentle, the many minutes in capture had saturated her wings with the natural oils found on the human hand.\r\n\r\n\nI now understood why Po\u0027s captures were so short. Catch, with instant release. This was the consequence of prolonged contact.\u200D\r\n\r\n\nHer cage was open, she attempted to fly, but couldn\u0027t. She laid on my hand and died.

Leave them in the cold to heal.\r\n\r\n\nReady for the next massacre. Master Po would disable them at will, abolishing hundreds with fast strikes and unorthodox technique.\r\n\r\n\nI could hold my own against one or two, but my skills had not yet matured.\r\n\r\n\nIn the middle of combat, I grew frustrated and how difficult it was for me. Too many close calls. Too many mistakes. It simply took me too long for each victory.\r\n\r\n\nI needed more power.\r\n\r\n\nHurriedly, as I ripped the throat from a spirit - I shouted: \u0022Master!! Please. I need power. Show me the most devastating move you know!\u0022\r\n\r\n\nPo, while crushing the skull of a downed opponent, replied: \u0022You could never execute it. You\u2019re weak.\u0022\r\n\r\n\nThis bothered me. I did not want my Master to think I was weak. As I continued to battle I attempted to show Master that I was strong. That I COULD execute any move he taught me.\r\n\r\n\nThrough anger, my Kagi Tsuki grew wild and inaccurate, my Kiai rushed. Suddenly, a Dragon kick knocked me to the ground. I spun and raised my hands to protect my face.\r\n\r\n\nI saw the sword raised, my decapitation imminent. I froze. Master\u0027s flawlessly Shuto Uchi ripped the spirit\u2019s arms from his body before he could take my life.\r\n\r\n\nArmless, the spirit screamed. Feeling real pain. Then Po\u0027s fingers ripped his eyes from his skull. Blind and in agony, yet unable to die, he ran screaming into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\nAt this, I was dragged to my feet, and we fled the field. Leaving a trail of destruction behind us. The ghosts were in pieces.\r\n\r\n\nThe battle was over. The walk back to Wudan was embarrassing. I was adept number 1.\r\n\r\n\nAnd yet, I failed. I died. And he saved me. To be saved by Po was an honor, he had a habit of simply letting people die for their mistakes, but I didn\u2019t feel honor. I felt shame.\r\n\r\n\nI expected more of myself. I was disappointed. I needed to learn more.\r\n\r\n\nI asked: \u0022Master, if I can not execute your most powerful move, will you at least show it to me?\u0022 Staring straight ahead.\r\n\r\n\nHe whispered... \u0022I\u0027ve shown you already.

Time ensures this. Sooner or later everything you love will be dead and gone.\r\n\r\n\nIf it isn\u2019t, you\u2019ll be dead and gone.\r\n\r\n\nMaybe the woman you adore will leave you.

In a life filled with love, a momentary loss is manageable.\r\n\r\n\nAnd finally\r\n\r\n\nLEARN TO ENJOY PAIN.\r\n\r\n\nIt\u2019s rare I feel sad. I\u2019m cerebral enough about myself to understand I\u2019m only human and that feeling sad is normal and basically unimportant.\r\n\r\n\nEmphasis: UNIMPORTANT.\r\n\r\n\nNobody cares how I feel.

I asked to be left to die, but Po demanded that I fight.\r\n\r\n\nSoon, a daughter of a previously slain bandit spotted us and fired an arrow from a ridge which landed squarely in my left foot.\r\n\r\n\nFearing gangrene, I removed my left foot with one slice of my sword.\u0022\r\n\r\n\n\u0022What happened to your hands?\u0022 I asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022My left hand was snared by a Golden Dragon in that now empty cave you children enjoy, to avoid being pulled into darkness and killed.\r\n\r\n\nI removed my left hand with one slice of my sword...\u0022\r\n\r\n\nHe paused.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022My right hand was caught in a bear trap the same afternoon, fearing death, I removed it with my teeth.\u0022\r\n\r\n\nI looked at his right hand\u0027s stump.

struck.\r\n\r\n\nI was asleep alone in my room when I was awakened by a crack of lightning which tore a small storage room in half.\r\n\r\n\nThe high winds whistled throughout the compound\r\n\r\n\nand although no one would dare leave their room for fear of Master Po\u0027s punishment,\r\n\r\n\neverybody was awake.\r\n\r\n\nThe following morning at 5 am I left for exercise as usual.\r\n\r\n\nThe rain had cleared and the devastation was obvious, the temple was damaged badly.\r\n\r\n\nMaster Po arose unusually cheerful and came out to greet us as we stood in Crane Position.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022Excuse my happy mood\u0022 he began.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022But I have no concern for the work you will have to do to repair this temple.\r\n\r\n\nI am very happy for all the water we now have to drink.\r\n\r\n\nStudents can give me work, but they can not give me water\u0022 he mused.\r\n\r\n\nHe was standing on the stairs above us, looking straight ahead into the empty

answered.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022Yes\u0022 With his mouth still an inch from my ear, he continued.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022Do you know that I am a master of the 7 Shaolin styles\u2026\u0022 he said as his voice escalated.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022DO YOU KNOW THAT I KILL AT WILL!\u0022 He screamed at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\n\nI began to cry. I nodded my head.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022Yes\u0022 I replied.\r\n\r\n\nHe then turned around and claimed the stairs back to his original position.\r\n\r\n\nHe ordered us to begin morning exercise like any other day.\r\n\r\n\n75 Years later the temple was as if never damaged.

Joseph Curley found that the Tate Brothers sufficiently pleaded defamation, defamation per se, and civil conspiracy. Regarding the defamation claims, the court held that \u0022Defendant has made statements accusing Plaintiffs of the commission of serious criminal conduct and\u2026 that such defamatory statements were made with actual malice in that Defendant knew the statements were untrue at the time she made such accusatory statements\u2026\u0022\r\n\r\n\nThe court\u0027s decision is a critical development as it directly contradicts the allegations against Andrew and Tristan Tate in their ongoing case in Romania.

- and, with vigor, would finish with a few minutes to spare before the 6 am training.\r\n\r\n\nThere was an old man with no hands and no feet - the only man, to whom Master Po would bow - who would sit atop a tree trunk and watch me complete this task.\r\n\r\n\nEvery morning, he appeared and watched in admiration.\r\n\r\n\nIt was a full 219 years, before I mustered the courage to speak with him. \u0022Why do you watch me sweep?\u0022 I asked, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022Ah, young Cobra, what better unison of the hands and the feet than sweeping a floor\r\n\r\n\nIf you were in my position, you would savour the task!\u0022 he replied.\r\n\r\n\nI looked at the stumps where his hands and feet once were, then looked up at him.\r\n\r\n\nHe knew what I wanted to ask... But I was afraid to appear disrespectful.\r\n\r\n\nTruly, it was none of my business.\r\n\r\n\nCuriosity got the better of me.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022What happened to you?\u0022 I said, looking towards the ground.\r\n\r\n\nI was sure he was contemplating reprimanding me. I was pleased, when he began to speak.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022Wudan was not always such a peaceful place,\u0022 he began.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022Warring tribes fought for this mountain\u0027s power and strange creatures lurked in every corner.\r\n\r\n\nBefore myself and a few brave others, including Master Po, banished them from the mountain.\u0022\r\n\r\n\nI placed my broom on the floor, sat down and continued to listen.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022While fighting bandits near the Yushu river, a water snake grabbed my right foot and began to pull me under.\r\n\r\n\nFearing for my life, and unable to see the snake through the bloodied water, I removed my right foot with one slice of my sword.\r\n\r\n\nThe only alternative was to drown.\u0022\r\n\r\n\nStill looking down, I raised my eyes to take a glimpse at his right stump. \u0022What about your left foot?\u0022 I asked.\r\n\r\n\nHe placed his right leg under his robe and exposed his left before continuing his story.\r\n\r\n\u200D\r\n\r\n\n\u0022The next day, I was limping and slowing the group down. I asked to be left to die, but Po demanded that I fight.\r\n\r\n\nSoon, a daughter of a previously slain bandit spotted us and fired an arrow from a ridge which landed squarely in my left foot.\r\n\r\n\nFearing gangrene, I removed my left foot with one slice of my sword.\u0022\r\n\r\n\n\u0022What happened to your hands?\u0022 I asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\u200D\r\n\r\n\n\u0022My left hand was snared by a Golden Dragon in that now empty cave you children enjoy, to avoid being pulled into darkness and killed.\r\n\r\n\nI removed my left hand with one slice of my sword...\u0022\r\n\r\n\nHe paused.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022My right hand was caught in a bear trap the same afternoon, fearing death, I removed it with my teeth.\u0022\r\n\r\n\nI looked at his right hand\u0027s stump. It was ragged.\r\n\r\n\nNot a clean cut like the others. It still looked painful.\r\n\r\n\nHe looked relieved when the story was over, it pained him to relive the events.\r\n\r\n\nHe took a sigh of relief and moved his gaze from me back over to the floor I was sweeping. I however was confused.\r\n\r\n\n\u0022How did you find the strength, to remove limb after limb in such gruesome fashion? I don\u0027t think I could do that.\u0022\r\n\r\n\nHe smiled. \u0022Well then you would be dead. And you would never tell your story to anybody, would you? I didn\u0027t find the strength to die.\u0022\r\n\r\n\nI bowed and returned to sweeping. The conversation made me minutes late for training.

This river had a single bridge. A bottleneck. And this bridge had a small town surrounding it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA town occupied solely by pirates, bandits and thieves, who would harass tax and rob anybody who had to use it. I had no choice but to walk through them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy now, my abilities were well known. I was adept number 1. Although Wudan had very few visitors, stories of the adepts\u0027 achievements somehow permeated the outside world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarried by the winds themselves. I intended to pass through the town peacefully, relying on my reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, as I approached the local tavern, a veteran warrior blocked my path. \u0022I do not fear you! I have been to war 5000 times and I still stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am ferocious, when I attack - and no matter how much you hurt me, I will keep coming forward!!\u0022 Eyes locked, in the center square - a crowd had now gathered around us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0022When you knock me down, I WILL GET UP!\u0022 he screamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0022When you strike me, I will continue to FIGHT!\u0022 At this he drew his sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI raised my hand with a single finger pointing towards the sky - as Po had done many times before to command silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0022Brother. Listen to your words. You have already said, I will hurt you. You have already said, I will strike you. You have already said, I will knock you down. You know the future. Apologize to me.\u0022\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe paused. His eyes twitched as he was thinking. He saw the crowd around him, jeering him on to attack a student of Wudan. His sword was already drawn, I was only a meter in front of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis eyes darted back and forth as he contemplated what to do - Attack? Apologize? By now the crowd was screaming. Urging him to fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a second, he made a decision. He swung his sword. As his neck snapped, and his body fell lifelessly to the ground, there was a loud moan of disappointment amongst the onlookers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0022Awwwwww...\u0022 The show was over. Not a single bandit bothered to check or show care for his body, they simply left him in the square to be eaten by the birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were so interested in the prospect of his success. And absolutely uninterested in his failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, the remaining bandits hurriedly afforded me safe access to the bridge.

Shallow graves. This place was reserved for those warriors which did not deserve rest. Murderers, cowards. Those, who killed without honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEternal peace was stolen from them, and their spirits suffered the eternal damnation of consciousness - upon a muddy field, precisely 1000 footsteps from the Gates of Wudan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey could not leave. They could not die. They could only live. Mortals did not visit this place. The spirits knew nothing but war their entire lives, they would engage instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey aimed to kill you. Upon haunted ground. To force you to endure their fate alongside them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever - twice a year, myself and Master Po would walk the 1000 steps and engage in combat. Lethal sparring, with eternal consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey would not die. So the aim was simply to disable them, render them combat ineffective. Leave them in the cold to heal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReady for the next massacre. Master Po would disable them at will, abolishing hundreds with fast strikes and unorthodox technique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI could hold my own against one or two, but my skills had not yet matured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the middle of combat, I grew frustrated and how difficult it was for me. Too many close calls. Too many mistakes. It simply took me too long for each victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI needed more power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHurriedly, as I ripped the throat from a spirit - I shouted: \u0022Master!! Please. I need power.

That I COULD execute any move he taught me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough anger, my Kagi Tsuki grew wild and inaccurate, my Kiai rushed. Suddenly, a Dragon kick knocked me to the ground. I spun and raised my hands to protect my face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw the sword raised, my decapitation imminent. I froze. Master\u0027s flawlessly Shuto Uchi ripped the spirit\u0027s arms from his body before he could take my life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArmless, the spirit screamed. Feeling real pain. Then Po\u0027s fingers ripped his eyes from his skull. Blind and in agony, yet unable to die, he ran screaming into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this, I was dragged to my feet, and we fled the field. Leaving a trail of destruction behind us. The ghosts were in pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe battle was over. The walk back to Wudan was embarrassing. I was adept number 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet, I failed. I died. And he saved me. To be saved by Po was an honor, he had a habit of simply letting people die for their mistakes, but I didn\u0027t feel honor. I felt shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI expected more of myself. I was disappointed. I needed to learn more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked: \u0022Master, if I can not execute your most powerful move, will you at least show it to me?\u0022 Staring straight ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe whispered... \u0022I\u0027ve shown you already.

Use your bare hands to cause as much damage to this tree as you can.\u0022\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI struck the tree three times, with perfect accuracy, producing a small dent in its bark and shattering the bones in my hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI returned to form and gathered chi, yet the pain was too much to bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI told Yan Hui, that I could not strike any longer.

He smiled as I attempted to hide the pain. And then he let go. With tears in my eyes, I returned to stance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI watched him reach up and pluck a leaf from the tree and let it float off into the wind. \u0022That part of the tree will surely die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tree will not be the same without it. That\u0027s damage, is it not? With my bare hands, no?\u0022\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe continued: \u0022You sit with a broken hand, I will pluck a few more leaves.

the other adepts.\r\n\r\nEach morning he would line us up, and force us to tell him what we dreamt of the night before.\r\n\r\nHe would often interrupt loudly and visibly angry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this

Atop Wudan we had 7 basic forms, a demonstration of the 7 Wudan styles. Po stood and watched me without moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few hours later, after reciting every form, I looked over to Po for instruction, but he did not move or speak.\r\n\r\nUnsure what to do, I simply started again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHours passed.

I had practiced all throughout the night and was well into the afternoon of the following day.\r\n\r\nPo was still standing in the exact same position, even the wind which shook the trees did not dare ruffle the fabric of his robe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was perfect stillness. Resisting exhaustion, I continued to train. Until deep in the next night I heard Po shout: \u0022Enough!\u0022\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had not had a moment\u0027s rest for two days. Not a sip of water.

As we stood in a line, PO once again pointed at me to begin reciting the story of my dreams from the night before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first time since my ascent to Wudan, I had not dreamed anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0022I did not dream last night, I was so tired.
